# chrometronome
A metronome as a Chrome App.

Why would it be good:
 - possibly would work on all platforms that have a Chrome browser installed
 - would work offline (no internet connection needed).

Unfortunately:
  - Google will end support for Chrome apps in 2018, so there's no sense trying to build a new app...
